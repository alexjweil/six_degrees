# Six Degrees

Inspired both by the Wikipedia page ["Wikipedia:Six degrees of Wikipedia"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Six_degrees_of_Wikipedia)
and by [this website]("http://beta.degreesofwikipedia.com/"), Six Degrees is a Python and Redis based implementation of the
six degrees game, with the goal of significantly higher performance than previous attempts.

After obtaining a suitable copy of the Wikipedia links and titles pages, just run
    
    pypy degreeGraph.py

And you'll be ready to go.
